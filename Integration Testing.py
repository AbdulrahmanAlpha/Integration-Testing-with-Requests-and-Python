#Integration testing is a type of testing that focuses on the interaction between different components of a software application. The following example demonstrates how to use the Requests library and Python to perform integration tests on a REST API:
import requests

# Send a GET request to the API
response = requests.get("http://api.example.com/resources")

# Verify that the response has a status code of 200 (OK)
assert response.status_code == 200

# Verify that the response contains the expected data
assert response.json() == {"resources": [{"id": 1, "name": "Resource 1"},
                                        {"id": 2, "name": "Resource 2"}]}
